		The detail can be described by equation \eqref{eq:heat}:
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:heat}
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - a^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + 	\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} \right) = f(x, y, z, t)

	In the memo, we want to introduce you an alternate typesetting program to the prevailing MS Word: \textbf{\LaTeX}. In fact, the history of \LaTeX\ is even longer than that of MS Word. In 1970s, the famous computer scientist Donald Knuth first came out with a typesetting program, which named \TeX\ \ldots
	
	Firstly, \ldots
	
	Secondly, \ldots
	
	Lastly, \ldots
	
	According to all those mentioned above, it is really worth to have a try on \LaTeX!
